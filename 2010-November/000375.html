<PRE>Hi Sarah,
sorry for taking so long to reply to your email. Please find my reply 
inline.

</I>
I really do think that hard coding the path is not a sensible idea. I 
also don't like that the files are downloaded into the source directory. 
Let me explain:
* I wouldn't expect automatic downloads from a make file and would be 
concerned about security. If you stick this into a script which the user 
has to run explicitly they can audit it for themselves (if they wish).
* Typically, I have many source trees and even more build trees. 
However, ideally I will have only a single gold standard. So 
automatically downloading the files into the source directories is a bad 
idea: I don't want to download it multiple times using extra disk space.
* Furthermore, the source directories might well be on expensive disk 
space (e.g. disk space with a nightly backup schedule on a highly 
available server) while the build directories are on cheap local disk 
where I don't care if I loose them. I might want the gold standard 
somewhere in-between, e.g. a networked scratch space. In our school we 
have exactly this setup so presumably that's not too unusual.
* At the moment only works for files that are stored on BerliOS, what 
about runs that are not there, i.e. some new development that isn't 
ready to be included in the gold standard but I would still like to use 
the test machinery to check that the code still works like the last time 
I checked.
* netCDF files compress quite nicely, so sticking them into a gzip'ed 
tar-ball reduces band width.

So, I shall be persistent in asking for a separate user-defined gold 
standard directory. It will address all the issues above. This location 
could default to the source directory and we could build a source 
distribution tar ball which includes the gold standard so that those who 
don't care can get the entire lot.

This way, when we build the distribution source tar-ball we should run 
all the tests and compare them against the previous set. They should all 
pass and we can include the new set of file in the tar ball.

So I think the second half of your compare rule is spot on. For the 
first half you just need to check if the file exists and if not print 
out an error message. The error message could be something useful like,
download the goldstandard tarb-ball from here and point configure at it.

Add a configure switch to specify where the gold standard lives. The 
directory structure of the gold standard should be exactly the same as 
in the source directory, i.e.
gold_standard/tests/EISMINT/EISMINT-2/
etc...



&gt;<i> To run a test cd to the test directory and type &quot;make e1-fm.1.nc&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> To compare to the reference file type &quot;make compare-e1-fm.1&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
exactly.

&gt;<i> Magnus, I was wondering if I could change the EISMINT-1 &amp; 2 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration files, to output a smaller subset of variables and time 
</I>&gt;<i> slices?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
sure, just go for it or send reduced output to another file.

&gt;<i> Also, what are the next steps to merge the tests to the parallel 
</I>&gt;<i> branch?. We would like to have the HO tests working in this branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>once all is working as it should, it will be a straight forward merge.

again, thanks a lot for looking into this. you are nearly there.
cheers
