Hi Flo,

I would think that's a sensible strategy. It will depend on how you're  
running Glimmer-CISM, though, and especially if the model is coupled  
to a climate model of some kind which has its own restart strategy.  
I've not used the restarts in Glimmer-CISM for a long time, but my  
recollection is that as well as building the model with restarts  
enabled, you have to manually call a 'write restart' subroutine  
whenever you want a restart to be written. I would also recommend  
doing a test of the restart mechanism to ensure it does give bit-for- 
bit accuracy (i.e. no difference between output when a given  
integration has been restarted at some point in the middle compared to  
when it hasn't).

Hope that makes sense.

Cheers,

Ian

Hi Flo,
instead of using restarts you can write hotstart files. These files 
contain all the variables required for hotstarting the model. I think 
Bill did some experiments with it and managed to get exactly the same 
results with an interrupted run as for a continuous run. Again, you 
should test this.
Cheers

Subject: [Glimmer-cism-devel] build error : which trilinos and mpich
	versions to use?
Message-ID: <4DCD0624.9010804@bristol.ac.uk>

Hi,

I am trying to build glimmer-cism using trilinos but have encountered a 
build error  (See below)

make[4]: Entering directory 
`/home/paleo/ggsrs/glimmer-cism-lanl/example-drivers/eis/src'
../../../libglimmer-trilinos/Makefile.Trilinos.export:7: 
/opt/local/CentOS-64/trilinos/trilinos-10.0.4-Source/MPI/include/Makefile.export.Trilinos: 
No such file or directory
make[4]: *** No rule to make target 
`/opt/local/CentOS-64/trilinos/trilinos-10.0.4-Source/MPI/include/Makefile.export.Trilinos'.  
Stop.

The version of trilinos that I am using (version 10.0.4) does not have 
the file Makefile.export.Trilinos. I am using mpich version 1.2.6.  I 
was wondering what is the recommended versions of trilinos and mpich to 
use?

Also, the code I am using is from 
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/glimmer-cism/glimmer-cism2/branches/glimmer-cism-lanl/ 
. Is this the correct branch to work with?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Sarah

Hi Sarah,

I looked back at Trilinos versions on Jaguar, and 
Makefile.export.Trilinos did not exist until 10.4.
For 10.0.4, you can use Makefile.export.NOX instead.

I just committed some extra lines in
  libglimmer-trilinos/Makefile.Trilinos.export.in
which shows the two lines you need for 10.0.4 to replace
the two lines for newer Trilinos. (You'll need to comment
out two lines, uncomment two others, and redo the configure.)
I tested this on Jaguar which had a 10.0.4 installed.

Sorry, I was so happy to just get the build system to
work on multiple machines, I didn't consider multiple
versions as well.

Andy
