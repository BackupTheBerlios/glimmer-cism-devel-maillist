absolutely, and that's what gc2-trunk is. as to who does the work. well, 
that has to be seen. at the end of the day, i think those people who 
create a branch surely must have an interest in merging it into trunk so 
it gets more widely used.

</I>&gt;<i>

again, i agree. however, we are currently in the situation where we have 
to sort out a number of branches and developments that go into various 
directions.

&gt;&gt;<i> we have a git repo (and had it for while). but it's not populated yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How is having an empty repository different from none at all?  If you
</I>&gt;<i> aren't using it, then it doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>it's slightly better than having none at all, in that the repo is 
created and ready to be used. as i said, i am happy for volunteers to 
get the gits stuff going.
