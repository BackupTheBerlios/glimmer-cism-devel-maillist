<PRE>Hi Rupert,

I can give some input as far as plume coupling goes.

For my current plume coupling setup the decision about mass balance (basal
melt rate) you are talking about takes place in glide.  I added a new glide
option which_bmlt. If it is set to 1 then glide expects basal melt for any
floating cells to be calculated by some external code (the plume in this
case, which it doesn't know anything about) so it doesn't write any basal
melt rate into the basal melt array.  My driver subcycles the plume model
during each ice timestep using the current shelf state.  Thus the plume
calculates a basal melt rate and can simply write those values directly into
glide's bmelt array since both models are run in the same process.  In this
setup glimmer-cism doesn't need to know anything about any far-field ocean
properties since the plume model is given the far-field ocean properties it
needs at configuration time.  Basically glide just needs to be told not to
calculate basal melt rate for floating cells (it currently doesn't calculate
a melt rate for floating ice anyway, I think).

It sounds like you are considering a setup where a full ocean model is
running in a separate process but doesn't calculate the basal melt rate
(because it doesn't know about ice? or it doesn't resolve the melt layer
well enough perhaps?) but rather glint pulls far-field ocean properties from
the ocean model and then uses its own internal plume model to calculate the
basal melt rate which it hands off to glide.  I hadn't thought of doing it
like that.  One argument against that is that (at least for me) the plume
model assumes a quiescent deep layer beneath it so its predicted behavior
would not be physically consistent with an ocean that was doing anything
much at all beneath it.  I would imagine that the ocean model would need to
own it's own plume model with which it is physically consistent that it uses
to calculate melt rates and then passes to glide via glint.

In any case, I would support having the ocean component (plume or full
model) own the basal melt rate calculation.  Then you can use an option
parameter like which_bmlt which would tell glide that, for floating cells it
just trusts that the driver somehow puts the right melt rate in
model%temper%bmlt.  The melt rate would have been written by the driver
after getting it from the plume/ocean model.  On the other hand, the actual
melt rate calculation is about 10 lines of code once you know the ocean
depth, temp, salinity and speed of the top of the ocean.  You could just
take those values from the top layer of the ocean model and perform the bmlt
calculation in glint (therefore no use of a plume model).

Cheers,
Carl Gladish
