Hi all,

Following last week's discussion of data structures for Glimmer-CISM,  
Jed and I had an offline discussion that may be of interest to others,  
especially those of you thinking about solvers and preconditioners.   
I've cut and pasted the full discussion below, in chronological order  
from top to bottom.  Comments are welcome.

*****************************

Jed,

Thanks for your thoughts.  Before I spam the group again, I want to  
make sure I understand the details of what you're saying.

Below I've pasted some text from Wikipedia--this is the preconditioned  
CG algorithm.  I'm guessing you would do something similar for other  
Krylov methods.  Each time through the loop, we have to solve z = M^-1  
r, or equivalently Mz = r.  Does M live in 3D?  Or does it live in the  
map plane and operate on a vertically integrated form of r?  If the  
latter, then I'm unclear on exactly how you go back and forth between  
the map plane and 3D.

Thanks,
Bill

Indeed, but recall that M is just some linear operation such that we can
apply M^-1, it is often not the case that we know how to apply M.

&gt;<i> Does M live in 3D?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Or does it live in the map plane and operate on a vertically
</I>&gt;<i> integrated form of r?
</I>
Maybe.

&gt;<i> If the latter, then I'm unclear on exactly how you go back and forth
</I>&gt;<i> between the map plane and 3D.
</I>
The idea is that M is the operation

  vertically integrate r
  apply H
  distribute correction in the vertical

plus (additive or multiplicative with above)

  &quot;tridiagional&quot; column solve

where H is the operator responsible for horizontal coupling and the
column solve handles vertical coupling.

Jed

******************************

Jed,

I think that the paste from Wikipedia may not have worked, but anyway  
you got the idea.

The combined application of H and a column solver seems a lot like the  
Bueler-Brown hybrid SIA/SSA solver.  Is the idea, then, that you apply  
this solver, or something similar, to the equation Mz = r (where r =  
Ax - r* is the residual of the full system)?  Then you use the  
resulting z to compute your next Krylov vector and step length, as in  
the standard PCG algorithm.  In that case, you need the following for  
an efficient (linear) higher-order solver:

* an operator that computes Ax, where A is the full higher-order matrix
* A Bueler-Brown solver to solve Mz = r
* a PCG solver to wrap everything

For full-Stokes you can't use CG, but the general idea is the same.

Now back to my original question:  Where in this process is it  
important to have the vertical neighbors close in memory?  Obviously  
this will make the column solve more efficient, that doesn't seem like  
the bottleneck.

Thanks again,

Bill

Yes, sort of.

Yes

&gt;<i> * an operator that computes Ax, where A is the full higher-order  
</I>&gt;<i> matrix
</I>
Yes, but note that this does not need to be assembled.  With Newton
schemes, it can be computed as

  (F(z+e*x) - F(z))/e

for some small e, where z is the state we are linearized around.  It can
also be computed by forward-mode AD (no storage issues, and easy to keep
contained so that only a small bit of code needs to be differentiated).
You can also hand-code the action, this is usually easier to write than
assembling the matrix anyway.

&gt;<i> * A Bueler-Brown solver to solve Mz = r
</I>
Pretty much.

&gt;<i> * a PCG solver to wrap everything
</I>
Yes, but this is *any* iterative method and you don't need to choose
until runtime.

&gt;<i> For full-Stokes you can't use CG, but the general idea is the same.
</I>
Well, you can use CG if you keep all the iterates in a &quot;benign&quot; space,
but you're right that it's not practical.  Instead, we would normally
use something like MINRES or SQMR if we have a symmetric preconditioner,
and GMRES or BiCG if we are using a nonsymmetric preconditioner.

&gt;<i> Now back to my original question: Where in this process is it
</I>&gt;<i> important to have the vertical neighbors close in memory?  Obviously
</I>&gt;<i> this will make the column solve more efficient, that doesn't seem like
</I>&gt;<i> the bottleneck.
</I>
Well, with this scheme, you do the following in 3D

* evaluate residuals (the full nonlinear physics)
* integrate in columns
* distribute corrections throughout the column
* solve linearized problems in columns

All of these operations operate on columns.  Now, if you only have
points per column, then you probably won't spend much time in it, you
may indeed spend more time in the crucial 2D operation

* solve linearized SSA in the map plane (a symmetric positive-definite  
system)

Note that the cheapest preconditioner for this system would just be
pointwise multiplication (this is called Jacobi and is actually used).
The next step up is to use 0-fill incomplete factorization on each
process (or relaxation like SOR which has similar cost), this only does
about 20 floating point operations per column, but needs
9*sizeof(int)+18*sizeof(double) bytes from memory (which will not be
reused).  These need to update ghosted values so the network latency can
cost quite a bit if your subdomains are very small and/or your network
is cheap.  As we move on to stronger preconditioners, we start allowing
fill in the factorization and/or subcycle on the 2D problem and/or add
coarse levels.

If you make the preconditioner very strong then it will likely cost more
than your 3D operations, but if it is cheap, then you also need to do
the 3D operations more frequently and they can be a bottleneck.  Also,
it matters if you have many levels because the cost of the 2D
preconditioner is not dependent on the number of levels.  In any case,
there are no operations that involve traversing the domain in layers.


******************************
Jed,

Thanks again for the detailed reply.  Just one more issue for now:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these operations operate on columns.  Now, if you only have
</I>&gt;<i> points per column, then you probably won't spend much time in it, you
</I>&gt;<i> may indeed spend more time in the crucial 2D operation
</I>

There's some text missing at the end of the first line.  Did you mean  
to say &quot;10&quot; or &quot;a few&quot;?

Which leads to a follow-up question:  Is there a sweet spot for the  
number of vertical levels?  I know that PISM uses a lot of levels  
(~50?), whereas Glimmer uses only 10.  Is there a number in between  
that would give us good cache re-use and accuracy while limiting the  
total number of column operations?  I doubt the accuracy question can  
be answered a priori, but I wonder if it might be pretty cheap to go  
from 10 levels to, say, 20 levels for our target architectures.

</I>
Yes that's what I meant.  (I accidentally the adjective. [1])

&gt;<i> Which leads to a follow-up question:  Is there a sweet spot for the
</I>&gt;<i> number of vertical levels?  I know that PISM uses a lot of levels
</I>&gt;<i> (~50?), whereas Glimmer uses only 10.
</I>
Note that PISM does not use sigma coordinates.  We do have unevenly
spaced levels so that the resolution near the bed is not too bad.  There
is a cost to low vertical resolution, mostly in how you predict the
transition from cold to temperate bed.  We usually try to use enough
levels such that further refinement does not significantly move this
transition.  It may be that higher horizontal resolution is more
important than fully converging the temperature system.  Also, it may
not be important to such high vertical resolution for momentum, but PISM
currently uses the same vertical spacing for both.

&gt;<i> Is there a number in between that would give us good cache re-use and

</I>&gt;<i> doubt the accuracy question can be answered a priori, but I wonder if

</I>
That cost is dependent on (a) single-process memory and (b) relative
solver cost.
