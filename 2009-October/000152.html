<PRE>hi ian

1/  could we have a structure where all of the various thickness are 
located in the same module/file?  there will be 5-6 in the end and all 
will have the basic structure of taking vel and mass balance as inputs 
and returning either thickness or surface (or both).  in a similar vein 
in thickness all of the velocity routines shpould be in the same module.

likely thickness solvers -
incremental remapping
piecewise parabolic
simple explicit euler
leapfrog etc
linear diffusion etc
bueler scheme

2/ there are some ancillary bits of code for finding lower surface etc 
from flotation and it would make sense to have them here also.  i 
wonnder if the standard should be that the DCR returns thcikness, upp 
and lower surface (ie that we ensure the thickness solver remembers to 
call floatation etc).  i think this would get over the problem of some 
solvers returning surface elavtion and others thickness.

3/ the floatation code is likely to be changed shortly to include a 
density calculation with firm depth (a 2d field).  this will be very 
important for antarctica and ensuring the GL is consistent with obs.

4/ the one exception to 1/ should be the non-linear diffision which is 
limited to O(0) SIA.   i think this is a separate methodology but should 
be retained as legacy.  it would not necessariliy then need to take vel 
as an input.

5/ i think the linear diffusion should be retained in module 1. because 
it takes vel as an input (e.g., from O(1) SIA models).

6/ i think the adi scheme can be dispensed with.

7/ the call to SLAP (or whatever linear matrix code we use) occurs 
several times within the code (eg isostasy and higher order vel codes). 
  it might be worth separating this off into a separate module.  this 
would be the subr that do the packing, the actual slap call etc etc.

all the best

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The linear and non-linear codes are very similar, so I would suggest

</I>&gt;<i> initialisation flag, if required. This keeps the amount of code to be 
</I>&gt;<i> maintained smaller.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Several bits of thickness code are used by both 'standard' thickness 
</I>&gt;<i> DCs as well as the ADI scheme, so I would suggest having a 
</I>&gt;<i> glide_thckShared module (or a different name) to contain those parts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All comments most welcome.
