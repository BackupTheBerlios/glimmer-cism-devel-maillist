<PRE>Hi Ian (and the rest),
I am looking through your changes and have a few comments/suggestions:

- I don't like the names of the procedures. I think it is clearer if
routines are prefixed by the name space rather than attaching the name
space as a suffix: 
  type_tempFullSoln -&gt; tempFullSoln_type
  init_tempFullSoln -&gt; tempFullSoln_init

- the temperature type is carrying around coordinate system info
  I think we should move that into it's own type so it can be shared
among other modules. I can look into that.

- everything is double precision - we should use rk which is either sp
or dp depending on configury options

- vertCoord type should contain sigma levels

- documentation is missing :-)

I think allocating large arrays on the stack is fine. I have used a
model with 10 of GB on the stack and had no problems (with newer linux
kernels - 2.4 died miserably). Allocating variables on the stack has the
benefit of making parallelisation using OpenMP simpler.

2) A question of style: the arrays in the interface to 
&gt;<i> tstep_tempFullSoln are currently declared as assumed shape (i.e.
</I>(:,:), 
&gt;<i> etc.). Since grid extents are contained in type_tempFullSoln, the 
</I>&gt;<i> interface arrays could have their shape explicitly stated (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> (params%ewn, params%nsn), etc). I think the latter might be better, as
</I>a 
&gt;<i> bounds-checking compiler should pick up if the subroutine is being

Yes, I think using explicit arrays also improves readability.


P.S. One of the consequences of refactoring is to make the code
slightly 
&gt;<i> less efficient in places (for example, some coefficients which were 
</I>&gt;<i> formerly calculated just once are now recalculated each timestep, to 
</I>&gt;<i> allow variable time-steps). My own tests do not indicate that these 
</I>&gt;<i> changes impact significantly on the run-time of the model (I doubt
</I>the 
&gt;<i> effect is measurable), and in any case they are the necessary cost of 
</I>&gt;<i> improving modularity.
</I>
well, we can worry about performance later and figure out how to avoid
recomputing surface gradients, etc.

Cheers for all the work and getting refactoring going. This will
definitely improve the code.
