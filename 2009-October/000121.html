Dear All,

I've now completed a draft refactoring of the temperature code in 
Glimmer-CISM. I would very much welcome your comments. As a reminder, 
the branch I've been working on is here:

/glimmer-cism/glimmer-cism2/branches/GCISM2-refactor-ICR

Some information:

1) The full solution code is now in glide_tempFullSoln.F90. The main 
calls are init_tempFullSoln and tstep_tempFullSoln. A single derived 
type (type_tempFullSoln) is used to pass grid parameters, etc, which are 
initialised in init_tempFullSoln.

2) The module as a whole only depends on libglimmer. However, to do 
this, various bits and pieces were moved from libglide to libglimmer 
(for example the several subroutines and functions which calculate the 
pressure melting point are now in glimmer_pmpt.F90). This in itself 
needs some reorganisation.

3) I separated out the basal hydrology models into a separate module. 
These still need some work.

4) Grid staggering has been moved inside the temperature code: i.e. only 
the 'original' fields are passed through the interface.

5) The refactoring has made glide.F90 messier, but this should be 
improved as more refactoring takes place.

6) I would be very much in favour of removing scaling asap, as it will 
make the dynamical cores much easier to use as stand-alone calls.

And a couple of questions:

1) Because of the way I did the refactoring - essentially taking the 
code apart and putting it back together - the necessary work arrays are 
currently allocated on the stack as assumed-shape local arrays. This is 
probably not ideal (stack overflow potential), but has the virtue of 
simplicity (no allocation/deallocation to manage). There are two other 
options: put the work arrays in type_tempFullSoln and allocate during 
the call to init_tempFullSoln, or use local allocatable arrays which are 
allocated and deallocated on each call. My suspicion is that for AD 
purposes the first of these might be best, but I'd like to hear Jean or 
Paul's thoughts on the matter.

2) A question of style: the arrays in the interface to 
tstep_tempFullSoln are currently declared as assumed shape (i.e. (:,:), 
etc.). Since grid extents are contained in type_tempFullSoln, the 
interface arrays could have their shape explicitly stated (i.e. 
(params%ewn, params%nsn), etc). I think the latter might be better, as a 
bounds-checking compiler should pick up if the subroutine is being 
called with arrays of the wrong shape.

As I said, please do read the code and send me your comments.

Best wishes,

Ian

P.S. One of the consequences of refactoring is to make the code slightly 
less efficient in places (for example, some coefficients which were 
formerly calculated just once are now recalculated each timestep, to 
allow variable time-steps). My own tests do not indicate that these 
changes impact significantly on the run-time of the model (I doubt the 
effect is measurable), and in any case they are the necessary cost of 
improving modularity. On this point, I broadly agree with Donald Knuth 
(author of TeX, etc):

&#8220;We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: 
premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass 
up our opportunities in that critical 3%. A good programmer will not be 
lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look 
carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been 
identified&#8221;
