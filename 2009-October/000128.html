Hi Magi,

Thanks for looking at the refactoring, and for your useful comments. 
Comments/responses inline...

&gt;<i> - I don't like the names of the procedures. I think it is clearer if
</I>&gt;<i> routines are prefixed by the name space rather than attaching the name
</I>&gt;<i> space as a suffix: 
</I>&gt;<i>   type_tempFullSoln -&gt; tempFullSoln_type
</I>&gt;<i>   init_tempFullSoln -&gt; tempFullSoln_init
</I>
I think it depends how you think of these names. To me, they mentally 
expand to 'initialise the full temp solution', 'do a timestep of the 
full temp soln', etc, so putting the action first makes sense. I think 
it's also visually clearer to put the bit which is different between 
different subroutine names (i.e. init, etc) at the start, rather than 
being caught between the namespace and the list of parameters.

But, this is largely a matter of personal preference. The main thing is 
to agree something consistent and stick to it. Would anyone else like to 
offer an opinion?

Of course, we wouldn't be having this conversation if we were using the 
OOP features of F2003... ;)

&gt;<i> - the temperature type is carrying around coordinate system info
</I>&gt;<i>   I think we should move that into it's own type so it can be shared
</I>&gt;<i> among other modules. I can look into that.
</I>
This is a tricky point - it's a question of how modular we want to be. 
One thing I was trying to do was to eliminate the need for the user to 
declare a load of derived types for the grid, etc, to be passed to each 
timestep call. So, the principle was initialise everything in the init 
call, then call the timestep with a single object representing the model 
and all its parameters. I like this approach because it means the user 
of the dynamical cores doesn't have to set up a load of derived types. 
Of course, we could still have an interface to the init call which will 
take a grid derived type in addition to the one which takes the 
individual grid parameters in a list.

But I don't mind what we do - again, it's important to have this 
discussion and then be consistent.

&gt;<i> - vertCoord type should contain sigma levels
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> - documentation is missing :-)
</I>
Indeed. :)

&gt;<i> Yes, I think using explicit arrays also improves readability.
</I>
Good. I'll move to using that style.

&gt;<i> well, we can worry about performance later and figure out how to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> recomputing surface gradients, etc.
</I>
Yes. Personally, I think the recomputation of surface gradients might 
well fall into the 97% which isn't worth worrying about, especially as 
the computational cost of the dynamical cores increases. However, it 
would be possible to provide pre-computed surface gradients as optional 
arguments, and only recompute them if they're absent. That might be a 
good solution.

Thanks again,

Ian
