This relates to plugins, as we were discussing them long ago.  I never
follow up with an example, but here is the idea (in C, apparently we
could do something similar with F2003; note that this chunk being in C
makes no assumption on the language it is being called from or the
language that implementations are written in).  Skip to the line of hash
marks (##) for the benefits of this design.


The public interface is something like

cism.h:

  typedef _p_DC *DC;                     /* opaque handle */
  int DCCreate(MPI_Comm,DC *newdc);      /* allocate */
  int DCSetType(DC,const char *name);    /* 
  int DCLoad(DC,const char *filename);   /* loads grid */
  int DCStep(DC,double dt,Vec x,Vec y);  /* take a time step */
  int DCDestroy(DC);                     /* deallocate */

  /* Associate a string with an implementation */
  int DCRegister(const char*,int (*)(DC));

  /* If command-line options are stored globally, you can have this
   * so that the type and implementation-specific options are easy
   * to set at runtime
   */
  int DCSetFromOptions(DC);
  
  /* To support implicit integration, you could include */
  int DCResidual(DC,double dt,Vec x,Vec xdot,Vec res);


The climate model only sees the interface above.  The implementation
looks like

cismimpl.h:

  #include &lt;cism.h&gt;

  struct _DCOps {
    int (*setfromoptions)(DC);
    int (*load)(DC,const char*);
    int (*step)(DC,double,Vec,Vec);
    int (*residual)(DC,double,Vec,Vec,Vec);
    int (*destroy)(DC);
  };
  struct _p_DC {
    struct _DCOp *ops;
    void *data;              /* implementation-specific data */
    MPI_Comm comm;
    /* anything else common to all implementations goes here */
  };


I assume that we allocate a different ops pointer for every instance.
This is more dynamic than a C++ delegator since we can override methods
on a per-instance rather than per-class basis (this capability,
sometimes known as monkey patching, should be used sparingly).  The
implementation of the interface (cism.h) looks something like

cism.c:

  #include &lt;cismimpl.h&gt;

  static int DCPackageInitialized = 0;
  static FList DCList = 0;  /* list of (string,function) pairs */

  /* function declarations for the implementations that are known,
   * various physics (shallow ice, shallow shelf, hydrostatic, stokes)
   * from various sources */
  extern int DCCreate_GlimmerSIA(DC);
  extern int DCCreate_GlimmerHS(DC);
  extern int DCCreate_PismSSA(DC);
  extern int DCCreate_CoolStokes(DC);

  static int DCInitializePackage() {
    DCRegister(&quot;glimmersia&quot;,DCCreate_GlimmerSIA);
    DCRegister(&quot;glimmerhs&quot;, DCCreate_GlimmerHS);
    DCRegister(&quot;pismssa&quot;,   DCCreate_PismSSA);
    DCRegister(&quot;coolstokes&quot;,DCCreate_CoolStokes);
    DCPackageInitialized = 1;
    return 0;
  }

  int DCCreate(MPI_Comm comm,DC *newdc) {
    DC dc;

    /* Initialize the package only once */
    if (!DCPackageInitialized) DCInitializePackage();
    dc = calloc(sizeof(*dc));
    dc-&gt;ops = calloc(sizeof(*dc-&gt;ops));
    dc-&gt;comm = comm;
    /* any other generic stuff */
    *newdc = dc;
    return 0;
  }

  int DCRegister(const char *name,int (*f)(DC)) {
    /* Suppose we have a generic data structure for this list */
    return FListAdd(&amp;DCList,name,(void(*)(void))f);
  }

  int DCSetType(DC dc,const char *name) {
    int (*f)(DC);
    FListGet(DCList,name,(void(**)(void))&amp;f);
    if (!f) ERROR(1,&quot;requested an implementation that has not been registered&quot;);
    if (dc-&gt;data) {dc-&gt;ops-&gt;destroy(dc);} /* destroy an old implementation */
    return f(dc);                         /* allocate space for the new one */
  }

  int DCDestroy(DC dc) {
    dc-&gt;ops-&gt;destroy(dc);
    free(dc-&gt;ops);
    free(dc);
    return 0;
  }

  /* delegate for the other functions, just trivial wrappers given here */
  int DCSetFromOptions(DC dc) {
    /* ... consult the runtime options and possibly change the type */
    /* ... other generic stuff */
    return dc-&gt;ops-&gt;setfromoptions(DC); /* implementation-specific options */
  }
  int DCLoad(DC dc,const char *filename) {
    return dc-&gt;ops-&gt;load(dc,filename);
  }
  int DCStep(DC dc,double dt,Vec x,Vec y) {
    return dc-&gt;ops-&gt;step(dc,dt,x,y);
  }
  int DCResidual(DC dc,double dt,Vec x,Vec xdot,Vec res) {
    return dc-&gt;ops-&gt;residual(dc,dt,x,xdot,res);
  }


Implementations look like:

glimmerhs.c:

  #include &lt;cismimpl.h&gt;

  struct DC_GlimmerHS {
    /* whatever private data is needed by the hydrostatic implementation,
     * it could just be a pointer to the Fortran derived data types */
  };

  /* These can be implemented in an language */
  extern int DCSetFromOptions_GlimmerHS(DC);
  extern int DCLoad_GlimmerHS(DC,const char*);
  extern int DCStep_GlimmerHS(DC,double,Vec,Vec);
  extern int DCResidual_GlimmerHS(DC,double,Vec,Vec,Vec);
  extern int DCDestroy_GlimmerHS(DC);

  int DCCreate_GlimmerHS(DC dc) {
    struct DC_GlimmerHS *ghs;

    dc-&gt;ops-&gt;setfromoptions = DCSetFromOptions_GlimmerHS;
    dc-&gt;ops-&gt;load           = DCLoad_GlimmerHS;
    dc-&gt;ops-&gt;step           = DCStep_GlimmerHS;
    dc-&gt;ops-&gt;residual       = DCResidual_GlimmerHS;
    dc-&gt;ops-&gt;destroy        = DCDestroy_GlimmerHS;

    ghs = calloc(sizeof(*ghs));
    dc-&gt;data = ghs;

    /* set defaults or call fortran to set up some private data structures */

    return 0;
  }




########################################################################

What does all of this achieve?

* Climate models all see the same interface with no knowledge of what
physics is going on underneath.

* An arbitrary number of DCs can be in use at any time.  Their types are
completely independent.

* Choice of implementation occurs at runtime.

* If you have a new implementation, you just have to get DCRegister(..)
called before DCSetType() and it will be first-class (and selectable at
runtime exactly like the &quot;blessed&quot; implementations that are registered
by default).

* With a variant of DCRegister(), we can distribute the implementation
as a binary and register it via dlopen/dlsym in which case nothing needs
to be recompiled or relinked.  (This is the strong definition of
plugin.)

* Implementations can be written in any language.

* The model can be called from any language.

* Implementations can share code at will (e.g. between Glimmer
components for different physics) but this is not visible at the top
level.

* Users can extend existing implementations in a very lightweight
per-instance way via &quot;monkey-patching&quot; or by creating their own
first-class implementations that reuses code from the other
implementation.

* The type of a DC can be changed after it has been used without
destroying it's connections to other components.  This is a benefit of
the delegator (aka. pimpl) pattern.  This would be useful to allow
*external* control to use one model for a while (e.g. spinup) and then
switch to a different model.  If all climate components were written
this way we could do some interesting simulations with very little
effort.  For example, you could start with reconstructions or trivial
models for atmosphere, ocean, and land while using a SIA ice model.  At
-4k years, you could switch to an implicit ocean model (taking large
time steps), then turn on a hydrostatic ice model at -1k years, and
activate an atmosphere model at some time close to present along with
changing to an ocean model with short time steps and more complete
physics, and switching to a Stokes model for ice.  All this would
require the user to provide one callback to the coupler (whatever has
top-level control) that would implement the logic of when to switch,
switching would not use the file system.



I realize this sort of thing is radical and may never happen, but I
think it is a noble long-term goal for the ice sheet modeling community.
It would definitely benefit the various ASCR efforts.
