</I>ok, I have done so now.

I think at this stage the proposal is dealing with implementation 
details while it doesn't deal with the larger issues. So, I would like 
to raise them (well, they are my large scale view...)

The first thing we have to address is the question what is glimmer-cism 
and more specifically what do alternative implementation of the 
dynamical core have to have in common to be part of glimmer-cism?

To me the answer is that they have to live on the same grid because that 
makes sharing of infrastructure such as I/O, coupling with the outside 
world, etc. easy. The alternative is to relax this requirement, in which 
case we would need to provide interpolation routines which transform 
data from one mesh to another. This is obviously possible but a lot more 
ambitious and we could consider that later once we have tackled the 
simpler problem first.

So, the state of the ice body is defined by a set of fields defined on a 
known mesh. Together with boundary conditions the next state can be 
computed. These fields are manipulated by the various dynamical cores.

I think we should first come up with an API for the dynamical cores and 
the support functionality. Once we have the API we can decide on how to 
implement it.

As indicated in my previous email, I really like Jed's suggestion from a 
while ago.
