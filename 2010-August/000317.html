<PRE>Hi Ian,

Thanks for the input.

&gt;<i> I would agree with Jed that a dynamic system (which is quite feasible  
</I>&gt;<i> technically) would be preferable to a static one.
</I>
I think there may be some confusion, either about what I meant in the
proposal, or on my end about what you and Jed mean by &quot;dynamic&quot;.

In what I proposed, there is no need to recompile the code when the
dynamical core is switched: in fact, within a single execution each
model instance can run a different dynamical core.  Recompiling only
has to occur when the list of available dynamical cores changes, so
that the libraries for the new cores can be linked.

The only way I can think of to be more dynamic would be to dynamically
link in an external library in the place of libglide, but
1) changing which library is loaded without relinking is done by
changing the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable, which is usually
discouraged,
2) this would force users to compile with shared libraries, and
3) this would limit to one dynamical core per runtime.

&gt;<i> One other point I  would add is that much of the work we've been
</I>&gt;<i> doing on the refactoring  branch has been geared towards making this
</I>&gt;<i> kind of architecture easier  to implement - doing this work in
</I>&gt;<i> isolation from that, and on the lanl  branch, substantially
</I>&gt;<i> increases the risk that it will never make it onto  the
</I>&gt;<i> publicly-released version of the code.
</I>
I'm agnostic about which branch to use.  -lanl was suggested by Bill:
maybe this is a steering committee decision?

Cheers,
Toby
