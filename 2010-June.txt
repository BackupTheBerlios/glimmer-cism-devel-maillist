Subject: [Glimmer-cism-devel] applying scale_factor in python
Message-ID: <4C0E6D12.1060101@ed.ac.uk>

Hi all,
I am trying to figure out the best way to apply the scale_factor to data 
loaded from netCDF file. Scientific.IO.NetCDF does not support this in a 
transparent way. netCDF4 does, provided the add_offset attribute is also 
present. There are a number of options:
1. rely on netCDF4 to do the scaling transparently - if you don't have 
the netCDF4 module you don't get scaled variables. It also automatically 
masks the array if there are missing values.
2. wrap the netCDF module in some clever way so that we can 
transparently apply the scale factor
3. apply it by hand whenever we access a variable

Option 2 would be neat if someone can think of how to do that. You don't 
seem to be able to inherit from Scientific.IO.NetCDF.NetCDFFile. So we 
would need to write some form of wrapper.

Option 3 is a recipe for disaster. We are bound to forget instances 
where we need to apply the scaling.

So, I tend to option 1 and make netCDF4 a requirement. We would then 
also need to add the add_offset attribute for scaled variables. I don't 
think netCDF4 is packaged for debian or ubuntu. It does come with 
enthought python distribution though so mac and windows users will be 
fine, linux users can install it from source relatively easily.

what do you think?

cheers

I agree that this is the best option, but as you say, you won't be able 
to inherit from Scientific.IO.NetCDF.NetCDFFile because it's a c-coded 
module/routine. On the other hand, it implements very few methods, so it 
should be relatively straightforward to wrap.

Cheers,

Ian

I suspect that Scientific.IO.NetCDF is written in such a way that you 
cannot. You can certainly inherit from netCDF4.Dataset. Ah well, it 
wasn't too difficult to write a wrapper class in the end. OO programming 
is quite amazing when you can insert some functionality into the middle 
of an application....

Anyway, you might have noticed that I have started reviving some of the 
old PyCF stuff, now called PyGC for Glimmer-CISM. One of my main goals 
for this reincarnation is that I/O should be totally decoupled from any 
display. So the PyGC/IO module only depends on either 
Scientific.IO.NetCDF or netCDF4 [1], numpy and my own wrapper for proj4. 
The I/O module can open or append to existing files or create new ones 
and it handles projection. In the PyGC directory are some shared python 
modules handling common command line options and loading GMT colourmaps 
for consumption by matplotlib. So far I have only ported the plotGCvar 
which will plot a variable from a netCDF file using matplotlib. If the 
basemap toolkit is available it will also plot coastlines and a 
geographic coordinate system.

Using matplotlib is certainly much nicer than the clunky GMT stuff I had 
earlier. At some stage we can consider to add a GUI to it all if we deem 
it's worthwhile...

Cheers
magi



[1] I realised that there are many more python netcdf bindings, all with 
a similar API :-(

Subject: [Glimmer-cism-devel] program files
Message-ID: <8CE1B868-1DFA-4DD6-8457-47F5CFE35FF0@lanl.gov>


Hi all,

For those who have an interest in glimmer-cism2 development:  I just  
checked in the latest contents of the CESM glimmer-cism source  
directory.  The CESM release is scheduled for next week.  This means  
we're almost ready for a Glimmer-CISM 1.6 release, which will include  
the new GCM coupling infrastructure but not the higher-order  
dynamics.  (The HO dynamics will go in version 1.8.)

Here's a question.  I'm wondering if it would be possible to include  
only modules, and not programs, in the libglide, libglimmer, and  
libglint directories.  This would mean moving the program files  
elsewhere, for example to somewhere in the example_drivers directory.   
Is there any reason why we shouldn't do this?  Assuming it's OK to  
move the files, where should they go?

The reason I'd like to move these program files is that CESM won't  
compile them, which means that I currently have to remove them by hand  
each time I copy a fresh version of the code into CESM.

Thanks,
Bill

There is only one program in libglimmer - nc2config. We could move that 
to the utils directory where it belongs.

Hi all,
the files in the libphaml directory have no copyright notices, there is 
also no documentation of what libphaml does. I would also suggest to 
move the libphaml directory into the extensions directory which 
currently only exists in the glimmer-cism-extensions branch.

Tim, since you added the code, is it ok to attach the copyright notices? 
Can you provide a short paragraph of what it does which we can stick 
into the README file?

Are you all happy to move it to a new top-level directory called extensions?

Cheers
magi

I'm sorry the code is not completely documented yet and doesn't have the copyright notices.  I have been working on this, but haven't finished and was encouraged to commit the code.  I will be finishing up the documentation and committing those changes.

The directory placement was not my decision.  Jesse talked with other people(I don't know who) and I was just putting the code where instructed.  I'm sorry for the confusion and I will try and get more information up quickly.

Okay.  Thanks for working on it.  Here's a list of other problems I know of besides just glimmer_config.F90 (which I see has now been fixed)

glint_initialise
glint_main
glint_timestep
glimmer_writestats
glint_example
glint_example_clim

And there are others but I got tired of reverting one after the other to try and fix the problems.  I'm on a bit of a time crunch to get things done, so I'm sorry for the rush of emails.

at work I am using a SL5.4 system which has relatively old packages.
However, I suspect there are many people using CentOS 5, RHEL5, etc out
there so using versions available and this platform seems to be
reasonable. So the autotool versions are:

automake (GNU automake) 1.9.6
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59
libtoolize (GNU libtool) 1.5.22
autoheader (GNU Autoconf) 2.59

Hi all (and in particular Bill),
I have started writing some visualisation scripts and also the erosion

we added them now, in particular the start of the visualisation scripts 
might be very useful.
What do you think?

Hi Magnus,

If you think the visualization scripts will be useful, please go ahead  
and add them.  I assume the erosion module represents new physics, so  
we might want to hold off till after version 1.6 is done.  The initial  
CESM release is scheduled for next week, and I'd like to tag version  
1.6 soon thereafter.

Thanks,
Bill
