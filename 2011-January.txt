Hi Sarah,
I have made some minor changes to the gold standard creator:
* make hard links rather than copies of the data files
* only create gold-standard directories if they contain files
* explicitly specify which data files should go into the gold standard

It works now as I expected. Currently only EISMINT-1 and EISMINT-2 files 
are considered. We might want to add more.

I tried the test suite on runs done with the model compiled using 
gfortran and ifort. They don't match! So I think we need to do some more 
thinking about what is acceptable.

Cheers
magi

Subject: [Glimmer-cism-devel] basal water bugs
Message-ID: <4D39D252.5070904@bristol.ac.uk>

Hi,
There were several bugs in the basal water scheme on the parallel 
branch.  The bugs resulted in an increase in basal traction with a 
decrease in water depth. 

The bugs were in glide_velo.F90 in two places.
1. subroutine init_velo where the parameters that define the shape of 
the curve between basal water depth and basal traction are calculated
2. subroutine calc_btrc where the basal traction is calculated

The values for the minimum and maximum basal traction defined as 'bpar' 
in glide_types.F90 were also reversed.

I checked the corrections into the parallel branch. I was wondering do 
these changes need to be put somewhere else in the repository to be 
included in the next release?. The bugs are in version glimmer-cism 
1.7.0 as well.

Cheers,
Sarah

Hi Sarah,
thanks for sorting these out. I lost track of the various branches. Do 
the bugs also occur in trunk and glimmer-cism2/branches/glimmer-cism-lanl?

As long as the bugs are fixed on the branch from which we cut the 
releases we are fine.
Cheers
magi

If they're fixed in parallel, then I will be sure to merge those fixes
to glimmer-cism2/branches/glimmer-cism-lanl.
