<PRE>hi

perhaps the option of having an automatically downloaded tarfile that 
contains the reference files is sensible.  it would make sense to have 
this located in an easily accessible location so that we do not create 
additional ftp issues.  does berlios offer such a space outside of the 
cvs? certainly for the eismint level 1 and 2 expts, the actual amount of 
data needed for the check is fairly small and could be limited to a few 
2d fields only.  i guess that we need to decide with the reference is 
there to flag when something has gone wrong (a small amount of data) or 
to point where it has gone wrong (potentially a far larger amount of 
data given the interdependence of many of the variables).

doesn't having personal reference files defeat the purpose somewhat?  
shouldn't we be aiming for performance that is platform independent? i 
can see that this may not be always be possible a byte level but i think 
the comparsion software can allow for a defined tolerance.

all the best

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Gethin,
</I>&gt;<i> the reference files are autogenerated relatively large binary files. 
</I>&gt;<i> Subversion is not particularly well suited to keep track of them, more 
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, binary diffs are meaningless. Large (even when small)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we wanted to we could add a script that automatically downloads a 
</I>&gt;<i> tar-ball and unpacks and installs it somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I am convinced that we will end up with a number of personal 
</I>&gt;<i> reference files, because of differences in compiler, architecture, 
</I>&gt;<i> solver, etc used. So, being able to just run tests in a known good 
</I>&gt;<i> source tree and pointing configure of the experimental source tree at 
</I>&gt;<i> the good source tree for comparison would be very useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another question is who will run the comparisons? I don't think a 
</I>&gt;<i> normal user will need to run the comparisons. They might run the tests 
</I>&gt;<i> to see how it works. The comparisons are more useful to developers who 
</I>&gt;<i> change the code and want to make sure that they haven't broken 
</I>&gt;<i> anything new. The other use is for us when we prepare a new release to 
</I>&gt;<i> check that things still work as expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'd strongly prefer to keep data files elsewhere.
