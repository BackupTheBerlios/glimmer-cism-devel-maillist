Hi Gethin,
the reference files are autogenerated relatively large binary files. 
Subversion is not particularly well suited to keep track of them, more 
importantly, binary diffs are meaningless. Large (even when small) will 
lead to bloat in the subversion repo and we have to be careful to 
restrict ourselves to small reference files.

If we wanted to we could add a script that automatically downloads a 
tar-ball and unpacks and installs it somewhere.

However, I am convinced that we will end up with a number of personal 
reference files, because of differences in compiler, architecture, 
solver, etc used. So, being able to just run tests in a known good 
source tree and pointing configure of the experimental source tree at 
the good source tree for comparison would be very useful.

Another question is who will run the comparisons? I don't think a normal 
user will need to run the comparisons. They might run the tests to see 
how it works. The comparisons are more useful to developers who change 
the code and want to make sure that they haven't broken anything new. 
The other use is for us when we prepare a new release to check that 
things still work as expected.

So, I'd strongly prefer to keep data files elsewhere.
