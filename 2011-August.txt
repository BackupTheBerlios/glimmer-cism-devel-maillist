Sarah,

Apparently, the problem has to do w/ the version of autotools being used. You need something >= version 2.6.2 (thanks to Jim Edwards at NCAR for figuring out the problem). I've just confirmed this by building this branch (most recent version your url below) successfully on Jaguar, using autoconf 2.6.3.

I'm cc'ing the entire devel list because I don't know where and when we updated the build to require autotools >= 2.6.2. Perhaps it happened during a commit that I did not see, or as part of the merge between the parallel branch and the gcm branch? At any rate, it would be good if everyone was aware of something as fundamental as a required change to the version of autotools being used.

There may be another fix so that folks don't have to update their version of autotools, but I would not be the person to know what that fix is.

cheers -

Steve
