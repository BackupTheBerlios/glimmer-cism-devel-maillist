<PRE>hi

i do not think it is true to say that the HO code requires the SIA 
code.  best to think of the 3 key functions that the dynamic core has

temperature (currently incl vertical vel)
thickness
horiz velocity

in the SIA thickness and vel are sometimes solved together in the ice 
sheet eqn.  the HO code MUST (or at least is very likely to) solve them 
separately.  it may well be that the HO code will use the temperature 
solver (there will be minor differences in the dissipation term).  a 
further complication, some is flavours of HO will provide vertical and 
others not, so perhaps best to bundle vertical vel in with the horiz vel 
code.  i was thinking that which vel solver is called for a particular 
region will depend on some field of  flags (slow flow, stream, shelf 
etc) so that SIA (where horiz vel is found separately from thickness 
evol), L1L2 and PP could all be potentially called.  perhaps the real 
difference is between an option that solves the ice sheet eqn and one 
that solves thickness and vel separately (be it with SIA, L1L2 or PP).

the other functions of glimmer (isostasy, climate, SMB etc) will clearly 
need to available to both SIA and HO codes.  there are issues about 
ancillary functions needed to find basal traction coeffs etc which may 
depend on which flow model is being used.

i think that the HO code will fairly soon become the default because the 
range of probs that can be done with SIA is fairly limited (assuming 
that a fast enough HO version can be made).  in which case making it an 
extension seems a bit obtuse.  if we have SIA/ice sheet eqn as the 
default we are essentially presenting a model that is 20 years (well 15) 
old, which may not be good PR.  i am not certain that we can tackle this 
separately from the dycore issue in that whatever solution we choose 
here should also work for the external dycores (and vice versa).


all the best

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> during the last Glimmer-CISM steering committee meeting, Bill

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are 3 options:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. add the code to the libglide directory and define a group of
</I>&gt;<i>    source files making up the HO model which gets added or not to
</I>&gt;<i>    the libglide_SOURCES
</I>&gt;<i> 2. create two subdirectories under libglide one for the shallow ice
</I>&gt;<i>    code and one for the higher order code. Bundle compiled object files
</I>&gt;<i>    into helper libraries which will be combined to form libglide.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. keep libglide as it is and move the higher order code to a
</I>&gt;<i>    subdirectory in the extensions directory. Handle the HO code
</I>&gt;<i>    like any of the other existing extensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I don't like option 2 because it suggests that the SIA and 
</I>&gt;<i> HO code are equivalent when in fact the HO code requires the SIA code. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be happy with Option 1 although it might lead to some confusion as

</I>&gt;<i> 3 would be ideal because the HO model is an optional add-on which

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
