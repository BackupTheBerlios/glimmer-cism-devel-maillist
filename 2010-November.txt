Hi Bill,

(copied to developer list for information/comment)

I can't say for sure, off the top of my head, but I think you need to 
add -DNO_HORIZONTAL_ADVECTION to the environment variable FFLAGS or 
FCFLAGS when configuring the build.

Hope that helps,

Ian

Message-ID: <4CE2A757.2060106@bristol.ac.uk>

Hi Magnus & developers,

The test suite is setup on the glimmer-cism2 trunk for the EISMINT-1 & 2 
cases.  The reference files are stored on 
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/glimmer-cism/. We have approximately 200MB 
space here. The test code downloads the files via anonymous FTP.

The location of the reference files is hard coded so there is no need to 
specify this at build time.  

Here is an example for an EISMINT-1 test:
 
To run a test cd to the test directory and type "make e1-fm.1.nc"
To compare to the reference file type "make compare-e1-fm.1"

Magnus, I was wondering if I could change the EISMINT-1 & 2 
configuration files, to output a smaller subset of variables and time 
slices?

Also, what are the next steps to merge the tests to the parallel 
branch?. We would like to have the HO tests working in this branch.

All the best,

Sarah

I really do think that hard coding the path is not a sensible idea. I 
also don't like that the files are downloaded into the source directory. 
Let me explain:
* I wouldn't expect automatic downloads from a make file and would be 
concerned about security. If you stick this into a script which the user 
has to run explicitly they can audit it for themselves (if they wish).
* Typically, I have many source trees and even more build trees. 
However, ideally I will have only a single gold standard. So 
automatically downloading the files into the source directories is a bad 
idea: I don't want to download it multiple times using extra disk space.
* Furthermore, the source directories might well be on expensive disk 
space (e.g. disk space with a nightly backup schedule on a highly 
available server) while the build directories are on cheap local disk 
where I don't care if I loose them. I might want the gold standard 
somewhere in-between, e.g. a networked scratch space. In our school we 
have exactly this setup so presumably that's not too unusual.
* At the moment only works for files that are stored on BerliOS, what 
about runs that are not there, i.e. some new development that isn't 
ready to be included in the gold standard but I would still like to use 
the test machinery to check that the code still works like the last time 
I checked.
* netCDF files compress quite nicely, so sticking them into a gzip'ed 
tar-ball reduces band width.

So, I shall be persistent in asking for a separate user-defined gold 
standard directory. It will address all the issues above. This location 
could default to the source directory and we could build a source 
distribution tar ball which includes the gold standard so that those who 
don't care can get the entire lot.

This way, when we build the distribution source tar-ball we should run 
all the tests and compare them against the previous set. They should all 
pass and we can include the new set of file in the tar ball.

So I think the second half of your compare rule is spot on. For the 
first half you just need to check if the file exists and if not print 
out an error message. The error message could be something useful like,
download the goldstandard tarb-ball from here and point configure at it.

Add a configure switch to specify where the gold standard lives. The 
directory structure of the gold standard should be exactly the same as 
in the source directory, i.e.
gold_standard/tests/EISMINT/EISMINT-2/
etc...

sure, just go for it or send reduced output to another file.

Hi Magnus,

Thanks for letting me know the reasons why you prefer a user specified 
golden standard directory. I hadn't anticipated a situation where 
multiple source and builds are used simultaneously. I hardcoded the 
location of the standard files to minimise user input, but I see why you 
would want to do it differently in some cases.

Ill make the changes you suggest:

1. Set the golden standard directory so it user defined when configure 
is run
2. zip the files on the berlios ftp server.

Ill drop you an email when the changes are checked in.

Cheers,
Sarah

Hi Sarah,
you are doing an excellent job, thanks being so patient with my 
particular wishes. I am glad I could convince you :-)

For extra bonus points you could try and figure out how we could 
automatically create gold_standard tar-ball. Automake allows you to 
create a distribution tar-ball by running make dist. I am sure we could 
use this functionality to create another tar-ball - say 
glimmer-cism-gold-standard by running make gold-dist or something along 
the lines. You'll have to dig in the automake manuals. If you get stuck 
drop me an email.

Cheers
magi

Sarah,

Following up on our discussion about:

1) getting the test suite set up and working on the parallel branch 
(and/or the Glimmer-CISM2 branch that will be part of an upcoming release)

2) adding gold-standard files for the ISMIP-HOM and ice shelf (confined 
and circular) test cases

Does it make sense for us to wait until the details are ironed out for 
the existing test suite (applied to EISMINT only at the moment), and 
then we can extend it to account for these other things?

cheers -

Steve

yes, let's get the mechanics right first. once it works we can merge it 
into the parallel branch and add more tests.

Hi Magnus,

The changes are checked in. Perhaps we can start merging to the parallel 
branch now, as we are keen to have the HO tests working there.

Regarding the tar ball.  Do you mean use autoconf to generate a tar ball 
to put on the berlios ftp server? I am not quite why that would be 
preferable to just putting a regular tar file there. Let me know what 
you think.

Cheers,

Sarah

Hi Sarah,
as a general request, could you add to the ChangeLog file whenever you 
commit something. Each modified/added/deleted file should have an entry.
You should limit the number of character per line to 79 so it fits into 
a standard terminal.

not quite there yet. I have slightly modified your change so that the 
gold standard mirrors the same directory layout as the build directory. 
This means that you can run all the tests in one build directory and 
which is pointed at as the gold standard by another build directory.

I would also like you to add another rule to the extra_rules file called
check-data. This will run the compare rule on all the data files 
produced by the data rule. you can use make macros to munch the list of 
data files held in $(DATA). Have a look at the make docs, here
http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Functions.html#Functions
you'll need to strip the suffix .nc and add compare-.

you will also need to add check-data rules throughout the Makefiles.am 
in analogy to the data rules so you can run make check-data in the 
top-level directory and everything will happen automatically.

hm, I had a quick check and there is no obvious way of rolling another 
tarball. So maybe adding another rule (say dist-golden-standard) in the 
top-level Makefile.am which tars and gzip's all the .nc files it can 
find might do the trick. just use find to get all nc files.

alternatively, we could add yet another option to configure which when 
enabled distributes the data files along with the sources. in which case 
i would set the default gold-standard directory to be the top_srcdir. 
you can conditionally add the data files by using an automake 
conditional and appending to the EXTRA_DIST variable. Have a look at the 
top level Makefile.am where I use exactly this pattern.

you are going to be an autotools expert by the end of this :-)

Thanks Magi.

Since our next merge will be between the current parallel branch and the 
glimmer-cism-lanl branch under glimmer-cism2, it might make more sense 
to just try merging the test suite into the glimmer-cism2 branch. That 
way we avoid any issues w/ having to do w/ the new directory structure 
(the next merge will use the new dir structure in gc2).

Hi Steve,
there is not much point merging the mechanism until we are all happy it 
is doing what we want it to. populating it with tests will be 
straight-forward and shouldn't depend on directory layout.

Hi Magnus,

I have added the 'check-data' to extra_rules.am and changed the 
Makefiles.am. There is a message in the change log file.

Thanks for adding the exit code and making the changes to mirror the 
gold standard directory. Ill mirror this directory structure on the 
berlios ftp server. There are currently no gold standard files for 
EISMINT/benchmarks, erosion  isos  lin-non_lin.

I was wondering if you have some available or shall we run the code and 
use the output as a gold standard?

Ill take a look at generating the tar file next and let you know if I 
run into problems.

Cheers,

Sarah

No problem. Ill do that from now on.

Hi Sarah,
it occurred to me that maybe we should not run all the available tests
and only a subset for comparisons, although it doesn't really matter,
it'll just take longer. I think that's a questions everyone should chip
in.

For those we want to keep and we don't have any existing files already
we just generate them.

Cheers
magi
