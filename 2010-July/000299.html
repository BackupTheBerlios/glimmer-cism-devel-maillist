an automated test suite would be very nice. i suspect it will be fairly 
difficult to implement. since we would need to take into account various 
bits of middleware that handle scheduling on clusters. On the other 
hand, there might well be an existing test harness we could use.

The other question is, how do we define a successful test? Do results 
have to be exactly the same (I don't think so). If not we need to define 
what is acceptable.

I anyone going to pick this up?

&gt;<i> Second, the ChangeLog hadn't been updated since May 2009.  Am I right 
</I>&gt;<i> that we're supposed to update the log when we check in new code?  Or is 
</I>&gt;<i> this somehow handled automatically?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The ChangeLog has not been updated. The ChangeLog is very useful. 
Although similar information can be obtained by looking through the 
submission log and figuring out which files have been changed, it is 
much simpler to just have a look at the ChangeLog. In particular, trying 
to figure out which files have been changed is a bit of a pain. I also 
quite like filling in the ChangeLog because it forces me to look through 
a changeset and think about the changes. Also, the person who submits 
the changes might not be the same person who wrote the patch.

To some extend I don't mind so much what happens on the branches that's 
up to the branch maintainer but I would insist on ChangeLog entries in 
trunk and the stable branches (and all the branches I maintain).

Cheers
