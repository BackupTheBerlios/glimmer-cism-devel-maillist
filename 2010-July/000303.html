Hi all,

A few more thoughts on testing:

I like the idea of automated nightly checkouts and testing, as Gethin  
suggests.  And comparing netCDF files seems like a good idea, although  
it could take some trial and error to figure out what the tolerances  
should be.

It would also be good to have some tests where we know to a high  
degree of precision what the answer should be--for instance, Ed  
Bueler's analytical tests.  My experience is that it's fairly easy to  
introduce a bug and not know it from comparing netCDF files.

I'd suggest that those of us who develop code suggest some useful test  
cases.  For starters, we could consider these:

* EISMINT-2 (some subset of tests A through H)
* ISMIP-HOM (a subset of tests A through F, for higher-order models  
only)
* Ross ice shelf (for shelf and/or HO models)
* the &quot;hump&quot; test on the parallel branch
* one or more analytical tests, as in the Bueler papers
* a glint-example test case for Greenland (I think it's important to  
test Glint, since it's a key part of coupled climate experiments)
* spinup tests for Greenland and Antarctica.  Here it may be less  
important to get a particular answer than to demonstrate that the code  
can run for a long time without crashing (though not so long that the  
test can't run overnight).
* some exact restart tests--very important for climate models

We'll have to think about which dynamical schemes (e.g., SIA and HO)  
and which options (e.g., evolution solvers and basal physics) to  
specify with each case.   Hopefully we can design a set of tests that  
give most of the code a good workout.

In addition to looking at netCDF files, the test scripts could compare  
diagnostic output in the log files, if that's useful.  The diagnostic  
subroutines are in the module glide_diagnostics.F90, and it's easy to  
add new diagnostics.

Developers who are familiar with the various test cases can supply  
appropriate config files (many of which already exist).  For instance,  
I volunteer to set up config files to test exact restart.

Then we will need some skilled software engineers (like Gethin) to  
write the scripts that do the testing.  Jeff Nichols, who is working  
on Kate Evans's ISICLES project, could probably help.  (Jeff, sorry to  
volunteer you for another task, but this one is pretty important.)   
Are there any other volunteers?

Cheers,

Bill

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an automated test suite would be very nice. i suspect it will be

</I>&gt;<i> Credential caching in Subversion is really handy in this regard.  It

</I>&gt;<i> make a fresh checkout on a nightly basis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a program that will compare (the intersection between) 2  
</I>&gt;<i> NetCDF files, allowing for tolerances in both absolute and relative  
</I>&gt;<i> differences (command line options).  This makes comparing an output  
</I>&gt;<i> to a reference file pretty straightforward.  Glimmer is very welcome  
</I>&gt;<i> to this program, and I can commit it somewhere if desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I create 'test-xzy' rules in the makefile, which trigger the  
</I>&gt;<i> relevant build and run commands (contained in small shell scripts  
</I>&gt;<i> for neatness).  The test definitions are encapsulated as  
</I>&gt;<i> configuration files kept in the repos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The remainder of the harness is a very small amount of shell- 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting (called from cron).  Like you say, people have different  
</I>&gt;<i> setups, perhaps including a queuing system etc.  I wouldn't bother  
</I>&gt;<i> trying to create something which works for everyone--this part could  
</I>&gt;<i> be bespoke as it's not many lines:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1- fresh checkout
</I>&gt;<i> 2- runtests in makefile (perhaps calling bespoke qsub command if  
</I>&gt;<i> necessary)
</I>&gt;<i> 3- run diagnostics script, kept in repos
</I>&gt;<i> 4- run the email script, also in repos
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The email part could send the results back to berlios in some way.   
</I>&gt;<i> I just email the key developers directly, as human intervention is  
</I>&gt;<i> required sooner or later if the tests show a failure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The other question is, how do we define a successful test? Do results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to be exactly the same (I don't think so). If not we need to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> define
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is acceptable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I anyone going to pick this up?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope the above is helpful.
