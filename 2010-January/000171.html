Hi Rupert,

Thanks for opening this discussion and putting together a strawman  
document.  In general, I think this is a good idea.  Some of your  
subroutines (for instance, glint_gcm_put_smb) correspond to routines  
I've written for CCSM.  It would be good to make these and other  
subroutines part of standard Glint, so that they don't need to be  
rewritten for each GCM implementation.

Also, I would like to reduce the number of optional arguments in Glint  
subroutines, especially in the case that we are passing the surface  
mass balance and many of those fields are not needed.  When working  
with CCSM, I've tried to modify Glint as little as possible while  
adding the capability to receive the SMB from the GCM.  This leads to  
fairly ugly code with many unnecessary arguments and subroutine  
calls.  Now that we have two GCMs (Hadley Centre and CCSM) sending the  
SMB to Glint, it would be a good time to clean up the code and develop  
some standard interfaces.

I would suggest we start from the most recent version of Glimmer on  
the repository, version 1.0.18.  (Ian and Magnus, please let us know  
if there are plans to update this version.)

At some point we'll want to merge these Glint changes with the higher- 
order dynamics and other code improvements that Jesse, Steve, and  
others have made in preparation for a Glimmer-CISM 2.0 release.  I  
don't think a merger will be difficult, because these other code  
improvements are mostly independent of Glint.

I will be writing to this list soon to suggest some changes in how we  
do restarts.  It would probably make sense to do restart changes in  
coordination with Glint changes, on the same branch.

Maybe we should form an ad hoc committee consisting of those who are  
keenly interested in Glimmer-GCM interfaces.  Ian, I would invite you  
to  join Rupert and me on this committee.  Is anyone else interested?

Regards,

Bill

</I>&gt;<i> conversations I've had with Bill and Ian last year.  To this end I  
</I>&gt;<i> attach a 'straw man' written in a combination of fortran and pseudo  
</I>&gt;<i> code for how the new interface might look.  If you want to play  
</I>&gt;<i> around with the straw man feel free to check it in somewhere - I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't know where to put it, I'm quite out of touch with all the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the main advantages will be ease of development and reduced  
</I>&gt;<i> chance of bugs on both the GCM and glimmer-cism side of the  
</I>&gt;<i> interface.  I think if we keep on expanding the large call we have  
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment we increase the risk of bugs creeping in on both sides  
</I>&gt;<i> as the GCM builds up its long list of arguments and glimmer-cism  
</I>&gt;<i> tries to decide what to do with them all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't see any obvious disadvantages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Questions:
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think this is a good idea in general?
</I>&gt;<i> If so, do you mind implementation being incremental? (We can add new  
</I>&gt;<i> functionality in this more modular way without having to undo the  
</I>&gt;<i> current large subroutine call if we don't have resource to do it all  
</I>&gt;<i> at once)
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any specific comments on the 'straw man'?
</I>&gt;<i> If we take this route, which branch should we use?  I am quite out  
</I>&gt;<i> of touch with the different branches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
