Hi Carl,
I volunteer! I couldn't download the plume code itself because of 
insufficient permissions. I guess I need an account on your subversion 
server. So I will restrict my review to the few changes to the actual 
glimmer code.

As you said, the changes are small and absolutely fine. So my comments 
are about style and only the file shelf_driver.F90:
* indentation is not consistent - I use xemacs as editor which has a 
nice fortran mode which does indentation automatically for you.
* I'd suggest to move the contained procedures into a separate file(s) 
which are then also linked to the libplume.a library. This way it makes 
it easier to use your lib in other drivers.
* I would also split up plume_read_print_config into two procedures. 
some people prefer a quiet operation. Also it is conceivable that the 
library might be used in parallel when you have multiple reads but only 
one print.
* is petermann a plume test case? If so could you add a readme.

Build system
------------
Let me guess, you develop on windows? Unix directory separators are / 
rather than \. So you'll need to change the file names for the 
libplume.a target.
Finally and most importantly, I think we need some way of 
disabling/enabling whether the plume code should be compiled. I would 
suggest to have it disabled by default and enable it with a configure 
switch. The configure.in contains some examples on how to do this, e.g. 
--enable-tests.

Finally, I think there should be some instruction on how to get the 
plume code in the README.

Do you have any plans to host your code on BerliOS or do you want to 
keep hosting it elsewhere?

Cheers
magi
