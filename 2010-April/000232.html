<PRE>Hi Magnus,

I found it too complicated to have trunk updates merged in my
plume_integration branch.  Now the changes in plume_integration between
r1410:1616 are just things that I did.

I carried out your suggestions in plume_integration.  In particular:

* I copied the plume code from my NYU repository into the Berlios repos.  It
is just made up of a handful of files matching src/fortran/plume*.F90
* I changed configure.in and src/fortran/Makefile.am to build libplume.a and
shelf_driver only if the project was configured with --enable-plume
* I changed the indentation as you recommended.
* Splitting up the shelf_driver seems like overkill to me at this second
* I develop on linux (I'll try not to be offended)
* In glam_strs2.F90 I made uvel and vvel intent(inout) in
glam_velo_fordsiapstr since the values in uvel and vvel as passed as
intent(in) args inside that subroutine.  That was a bug with the sun f90
compiler (I think... it was a while ago that I saw that).
* In glide_temp.F90 calcbmlt I made bmlt intent(inout) because in the case
that the subroutine doesn't write a value to bmlt (floating cells with the
plume turned on), I don't want to compiler to think we don't care what the
values in bmlt are (since they will be values calculated by the plume model
outside of that subroutine somewhere).

You can confirm these things by running

svn diff -r1410:1616 <A HREF="https://&lt;you">https://&lt;you</A>&gt;@
svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/glimmer-cism/glimmer-cism-lanl/branches/plume_integration

Also, I have merged those changes into my copy of the trunk (not committed
though).  There were some conflicts, which I resolved by hand.  The
resulting diffs are in the attached file.

I consider those diffs to be ready to commit in trunk.  What do you think?
If you would rather do the merge yourself, feel free.

-Carl

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Carl,
</I>&gt;<i> I volunteer! I couldn't download the plume code itself because of
</I>&gt;<i> insufficient permissions. I guess I need an account on your subversion
</I>&gt;<i> server. So I will restrict my review to the few changes to the actual
</I>&gt;<i> glimmer code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you said, the changes are small and absolutely fine. So my comments are
</I>&gt;<i> about style and only the file shelf_driver.F90:
</I>&gt;<i> * indentation is not consistent - I use xemacs as editor which has a nice
</I>&gt;<i> fortran mode which does indentation automatically for you.
</I>&gt;<i> * I'd suggest to move the contained procedures into a separate file(s)
</I>&gt;<i> which are then also linked to the libplume.a library. This way it makes it
</I>&gt;<i> easier to use your lib in other drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> * I would also split up plume_read_print_config into two procedures. some
</I>&gt;<i> people prefer a quiet operation. Also it is conceivable that the library
</I>&gt;<i> might be used in parallel when you have multiple reads but only one print.
</I>&gt;<i> * is petermann a plume test case? If so could you add a readme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Build system
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i> Let me guess, you develop on windows? Unix directory separators are /
</I>&gt;<i> rather than \. So you'll need to change the file names for the libplume.a
</I>&gt;<i> target.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally and most importantly, I think we need some way of
</I>&gt;<i> disabling/enabling whether the plume code should be compiled. I would
</I>&gt;<i> suggest to have it disabled by default and enable it with a configure
</I>&gt;<i> switch. The configure.in contains some examples on how to do this, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> --enable-tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I think there should be some instruction on how to get the plume
</I>&gt;<i> code in the README.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any plans to host your code on BerliOS or do you want to keep
</I>&gt;<i> hosting it elsewhere?
</I>&gt;<i>
