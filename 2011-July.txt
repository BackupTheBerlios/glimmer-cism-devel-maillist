   This is a minor bug report.

The error message in bold below could be more helpful.?? Should be:

-- Bob

glimmer-config is installed
*** IN YOUR PATH OR RUN CONFIGURE WITH THE --GLIMMER_PREFIX OPTION.

Subject: [Glimmer-cism-devel] glimmer-cism-lanl (Revision 2385) convergence
	issues
Message-ID: <CAPUAMGYZozFPp9ALwk_qr0B37sKZtEF31i6a33ezv9++a+6sjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have installed glimmer-cism-lanl (Revision 2385) and have been running
some of the higher order tests using the python and config files provided.
The dome test produces the expected output (i.e. a maximum velnorm of 73
m/yr with a concentric pattern). However, the circular and confined shelf
experiments do not converge. The circular shelf run has a residual of
12090.6 after 300 iterations, and the maximum velnorm is 202764 m/yr, while
the confined shelf run has a residual of 275.992 after 300 iterations and
the maximum velnorm is 1.14e6 m/yr. I realise from the README file in
tests/higher-order/ross that the ross test is not expected to converge, but
the residual for my test increases to  10270.2 after 300 iterations and the
maximum velnorm is 5.5e6 m/yr. Has anyone experienced this problem before?
Your help would be much appreciated!

Many thanks,

Andrew Sole
