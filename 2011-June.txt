Hi Bill,
the configure script is autogenerated and shouldn't go into the version 
control system. However, for production runs you should probably use 
released versions of GC anyway. If you build a source-tar ball (make 
dist) you get the bootstrapped built environment with the tar-ball. 
That's also why it would be quite good to have regular (minor) stable 
releases. On production machines you just grab the released source tar 
ball from berlios. Alternatively, you can create a tar-ball on your 
development system (make dist) and move it to your target machine.
Cheers

Hi Bill and Magi,

I think the released version of Glimmer-CISM (i.e. tarballs from 
BerliOS) needs to work in the way Magi described, and the development 
versions on BerliOS also need to be bootstrap-able on any relevant 
platform. I don't think it's a good idea for the development version to 
be tied to Jaguar, Bluefire, etc.

If the bootstrapping process is very different between these HPC 
platforms and a regular Linux machine, would it be possible to provide 
two bootstrap scripts? Or make the one script do different things 
dependent on the result of 'uname -a'?

Cheers,

Ian

The problem with the bootstrap is that you need all the autoconf stuff.
Once you have run bootstrap to create the configure script you should be
fine, that's just a shell script and possibly m4 (although I can't
remember). The whole idea is that you have a single system that can
generate a build system that can be used anywhere - or at least that's
the theory. IBM systems are a bit tricky because of the IBM compiler
which is very different from all other compilers. Detecting that is no
problem though and we might need to add some macros to fully support the
IBM fortran compiler.

Subject: [Glimmer-cism-devel] GCM restarts, SMB and subgrid hypsometry
Message-ID: <4DF8BEC3.2090109@zmaw.de>

Hi all,

I'm working on improving the coupling between Glimmer-CISM and (an old 
version of) the UKMO Unified Model, and I have a few questions I hope 
someone may be able to shed some light on.

Our previous setup used "proper" restarts from Glimmer, not just 
hotstarts, which don't appear to be available any more in Glimmer-CISM 
STABLE_1.6. In addition, we're looking at means of generating the 
surface mass balance terms directly in the GCM, including some simple 
orography-dependent downscaling from the GCM resolution.

The guys at Bristol thought that the CESM-Glimmer coupling had already 
addressed issues like that, at least for their model, and might be 
available on another branch. I'd really appreciate a look at any code 
that's already been done if possible - could anyone who knows about the 
CESM coupling advise me further?

cheers,

robin

Hi Robin,

I think I can address these questions.  I'll reply to you later in the  
day with some details about how we're handling restarts and SMB  
downscaling using Glimmer-CISM in CESM.

Cheers,

Bill

Hello,

I am trying to install the glimmer-cism-lanl branch of Glimmer-CISM on eddie
at the University of Edinburgh
https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/ecdfwiki/Eddie+and+the+ECDF

I have successfully done (with some help from Magnus Hagdorn)

./configure FC=ifort CC=gcc --with-netcdf=$NETCDF_HOME --with-sge-jobs="-l
h_rt=2:0:0"--enable-extension-erosion

but am now having trouble with make. It gets a fair way through and then I
get

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

and it stops. If I try make install I get

Hi Andrew,

I think this may be due to linkage with a C++ compiler?  In any case we
had something similar recently (when linking with trilinos).

The way I got around our problem was--by hook or by crook--to add in
for_main.o (for ifort) into the link line.

If, say, $IFORT_INSTALL_DIR, were set to where your compiler is
installed, then something like:

LDFLAGS="$IFORT_INSTALL_DIR/lib/for_main.o" might add in the missing
dependency to your link line and so do the trick for you.

Best wishes,
Gethin.
