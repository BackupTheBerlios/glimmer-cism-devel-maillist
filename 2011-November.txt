Subject: [Glimmer-cism-devel] higher-order code
Message-ID: <4EB91C56.8020409@ed.ac.uk>

Hi all,
I am trying to run the higher order code as checked out from berliOS
https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/glimmer-cism/glimmer-cism2/branches/glimmer-cism-lanl
Revision: 2460

To start with I ran the the higher order test in
tests/higher-order/
they seem to be doing what I expect.

I then tried to modify the setup for the EISMINT-2 tests a and b to use 
the higher order code instead of the SIA. I added the following lines to 
the config file (test A):
[ho_options]
diagnostic_scheme = 1   # Payne/Price 1st-order dynamics
prognostic_scheme = 1
which_ho_babc = 4       # no-slip at bed
which_ho_efvs = 0       # nonlinear eff. visc. w/ n=3
which_ho_sparse = 1     # 1=SLAP GMRES, 4=Trilinos for linear solver
which_ho_nonlinear = 0  # 0=Picard, 1=JFNK

However, I don't seem to accumulate any ice. What did I miss?

Cheers
magi

Magi,

What is your setting for "evolution" under [options]? To run the higher-order solver, this should be set to 3.

I doubt this is all you need to do to get it to work, however. Are EISMINT-2 moving margin experiments? You'll have some trouble with that, as there is currently no good scheme implemented in the code to get a terrestrial margin to advance (retreat is easy, but advance is not). I'm working on that now, but the default is probably that it will specify zero vel. there. 

Or, are you building an ice sheet from scratch in this experiment?

Steve

yes, it is set to 3.

the eismint-2 A test grows an ice sheet from scratch.

the eismint-2 B test takes the ice sheet from A and increases the
temperature. i tried using the ho code to run eismint-2 B starting from
a SIA eismint-2 A run. this also doesn't work. it looks like there are
some scaling issues.
