Hi Magnus,
 
I added the rule dist-gold-standard to create a tar file containing the 
output of all the tests. The tar file has the version number of the code 
in the filename.

I used 'find' to get a list of the netCDF files and created the tar file 
from the list. Perhaps we are ready to think about the next steps for 
merging the test suite to the parallel branch?

Cheers,

Sarah

Hi Sarah,
sorry it took me so long again to have a look at what you have done...
in no particular order.

configure.in:
the option should be called
--with-gold-std rather than --with-gold_std

extra_rules.am:
compare-% rule - you should report which test passed or failed, e.g. 
echo test $< passed
also you should use the macro $< instead of $^
check-data rule:
you don't need a loop here. just use a substitution
check-data: $(patsubst %.nc, compare-%,$(data))

i'd suggest to call the gold-standard tar-ball
glimmer-cism-gold-version.tar.gz, i.e. $(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION)
have a look at the generated Makefile to figure out how automake creates 
a tar-ball. Essentially, I think you need to have a rule that creates 
and populates the directory you want to distribute, and then a second 
rule which tars and gzips this directory and cleans up after itself.
I think using the find command is fine, you can create the directory 
structure by first extracting all the directories from the list of files 
to distribute, sorting them and running the list through uniq and then 
mkdir -p; you can then copy the files into the new directory structure, 
or if you want create hard links.
This is probably not as portable as the original automake stuff but a 
lot less work, if we run into problems we can fix them later.

You also have the dist-gold-standard rule in both the top-level 
Makefile.am and the extra_rules.am, just keep it in the Makefile.am.


Nearly there.
Cheers
magi

Hi Magnus, 

Thanks for taking a look and getting back to me.

I have made all the changes that you suggested apart from the last one. 
Here are the changes : 

1. In configure.in: changed --with-gold_std to --with-gold-std

2. In check-data rule I replaced

    @$(foreach data,$(data), make compare-$(basename $(data));)  with

    @make $(patsubst %.nc,  compare-%, $(data))

3. In the compare rule I replaced echo "test passed" with echo "test $< 
passed" . Instances of $^ replaced with $<

4. Changed the naming of the tar file from
 gold-standard_$(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION) .tgz to $(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION).tgz

5. Removed dist-gold-standard rule from extra_rules.am.  It only occurs 
in the top-level Makefile.am now.

6. Regarding the tar ball.  The directory structure of the tar ball has 
the same layout as the test directory. i.e tests/ EISMINT/EISMINT-1 etc. 
If you un-zip the tar file you will be able to see this. Why is it 
necessary to re-create this directory structure, copy the files into the 
new directory and then compress it, when the same tar ball can be 
produced in one command? Maybe I've misunderstood something 
obvious............

Cheers,
Sarah

This should be .tar.gz

you are missing the top-level directory you would get
glimmer-cism-gold-1.2.3/test/....
rather than just
tests/
this allows you to unpack more than one version of the standard.

so you need to create a directory
$(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION)
copy all the test directory structure into that and copy the files you 
want to distribute.
tar up the entire directory
remove the directory and its children.

I hope this clarifies my request.

Cheers
magi

OK, I see now. Thanks for clarifying that.

Hi Sarah,
it occurred to me this morning that you actually don't need to use the
find command. You can use the $(relbuild_dir) macro to create the
directories in the  top gold-distrib dir, i.e.
mkdir -p $(top_builddir)/$(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION)/$(rel_builddir)
and then loop over the files in the $(DATA) macro and copy them into the
directory. That way we can tell the system exactly what should get
distributed.
Cheers
magi

Hi Magnus,

Just to clarify that this is what you want instead of using the find 
command.

1. Copy the test files into a directory by adding the following to 
extra_rules.am

dist-gold-standard:
    @mkdir -p $(top_builddir)/$(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION)/$(rel_builddir)
    $(foreach data,$(data), cp $(data) 
$(top_builddir)/$(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION)/$(rel_builddir);)

2. In the top level Makefile.am add the following to repeat the rule and 
compress the files
dist-gold-standard::
        list='$(datadir)'; for dir in $$list; do \
          (cd $$dir && $(MAKE) $@); \
        done
        tar -cvzf $(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION).tar.gz 
$(top_builddir)/$(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION) 
        echo "Output of tests compressed to" 
$(PACKAGE)-gold-$(VERSION).tar.gz

3.  Add the rule to Makefile.am contained in each subdirectory of the 
tests directory.
dist-gold-standard::
        list='$(datadir)'; for dir in $$list; do \
          (cd $$dir && $(MAKE) $@); \
        done
Is that correct?
Cheers,
Sarah

Hi all,

As you may have noticed, I've recently made a number of changes on the  
glimmer-cism-lanl parallel branch.  If you're not working with that  
branch, you can ignore the rest of this message.

The recent changes allow for advection of temperature (and other  
tracers, if you like) using the incremental remapping scheme.  Here's  
what you need to know:

(1) The next time you do an svn update, you will need to clean,  
reconfigure, and rebuild the code.  This is because I've added some  
files, removed others, and made some changes in .../src/fortran/ 
Makefile.am.

(2) If you're not interested in remapping of temperature, there's  
nothing else you need to do.  Existing config files should work in the  
same way.  The most recent revisions (r2145-2149) should not change  
any answers for prior configurations.  If they do, please let me know!

(3) If you're interested in remapping of temperature or other tracers,  
please read the message associated with r2145 and try out the new  
option.  You will need to set evolution = 3 and temperature = 3 in the  
options section of the config file.   Recall that evolution = 3 turns  
on the remapping option for thickness.  Setting temperature = 3 turns  
on the remapping option for temperature as well.  I've tested the new  
option for the hump test case with Payne-Price dynamics, but not yet  
for the more realistic test cases.

(4) During the next few weeks, Jeff Nichols and I will be porting  
these changes over to the glimmer-cism-lanl distributed branch, so  
that the remapping of thickness and temperature can be done in parallel.

Please let me know if you have any questions or run into problems.

Happy new year,

Bill
