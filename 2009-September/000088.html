<PRE>Hi all,
We have three active development branches at the moment and we are
likely to have more soon. So I thought I should suggest a couple of
rules of how to use them. We have

* glimmer-cism/glimmer/branches/RELEASE_1_0_0_BRANCH/
  This is the current stable release branch we shouldn't do any
development here and focus our efforts on getting glimmer-cism v2 out.

* glimmer-cism/glimmer/branches/lanl
  The higher order code branch and various useful improvements. This
branch is under active development however, it is due to be branched
soon for investigating parallelisation

* glimmer-cism2/trunk
  This is the new module which will become gc2. Currently it contains
the same code as the current stable branch. The only main difference is
that files have been redistributed over a number of directories. I would
suggest to keep this branch as close to stable as possible so that
merging things from the lanl branch is easier.

* glimmer-cism2/branches/GCISM2-refactor-ICR
  Ian has started the refactoring process. Files can get renamed,
chopped up, etc. I suspect we will need to merge from
glimmer-cism2/trunk occasionally. This will be quite painful (I know
git/hg might help here) so we should keep this at a minimum and when we
do document the revision number in the commit and change log.

Steve has asked me to create a lanl branch for parallelisation work. So
I have created a new top-level module called
glimmer-cism-lanl
We should copy glimmer-cism/glimmer/branches/lanl to
glimmer-cism-lanl/trunk. Once that is done you will need to rebase your
repo [1] to point to the new location and
glimmer-cism/glimmer/branches/lanl will become read-only. We can then
create the branch for the parallelisation work.
Steve et al. can you let me know when a convinient time is to do the
copying? 

Cheers
magi
