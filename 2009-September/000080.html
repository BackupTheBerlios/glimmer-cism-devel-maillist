Hi Magi,

Thanks for looking at the patches, and for your comments. I think I'm 
beginning to make some progress on the refactoring now, at least as an 
example.

 &gt; - should we move the vertical velos into a separate file? I guess the
 &gt; velos are always used together so maybe not. I also guess that the
 &gt; higher order code will provide a new way of computing the velo field.

Perhaps. For the moment, I'm just content with the fact that they're not 
longer calculated in the temperature module. :)

 &gt; - come up with a consistent naming scheme, e.g. i quite like to call
 &gt; derived types something along the lines of
 &gt;   timederiv_type

Yes, we definitely need this. I'll admit that I've been very sloppy on 
this front during the last couple of weeks, but it was too much to think 
about. Hopefully, the new structure will make it easier to go back and 
make things more consistent later. (Ok, that's a dangerous thing to say)

 &gt; - personally I prefer to use
 &gt;   if () then
 &gt;    something
 &gt;   end if
 &gt;   blocks rather than line continuation. it makes it easier to read,
 &gt; especially when indented properly.

Good point - have corrected this.

A set of coding guidelines would be very useful, if you have them, 
Jesse. Let's put them on the wiki.

Cheers,

Ian
