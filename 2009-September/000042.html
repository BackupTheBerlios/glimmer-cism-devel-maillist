Hi All,

Yes, restarts are a problem in various ways, since although the restart 
code is auto-generated, it still relies on being stitched together 'by 
hand', as it were.

To clarify, though, my suggestion wasn't that we write our own parser 
using ANTLR, but to replace my somewhat ad-hoc parser (written in 
Python) with the already-existing Open Fortran Parser, which uses ANTLR:

<A HREF="http://fortran-parser.sourceforge.net/">http://fortran-parser.sourceforge.net/</A>

The difficulty is that OFP is configured to produce Java rather than 
Python. I have been in touch with Craig Rasmussen at LANL, who is 
involved with the development of OFP, but haven't had a chance to see 
whether this would be beneficial to us.

Checkpointing is a useful concept, but I wonder whether it's not 
flexible enough for us. If a system has a checkpointing capability, then 
it has to affect the whole of the running process. However, users may 
want to do something more sophisticated (e.g. climate models are 
frequently started from a restart dump, but with different parameters, 
and they want to do the same with the coupled ice sheet component). The 
hotstart mechanism in Glimmer works well for the core model, but isn't 
perhaps all-encompassing enough for coupled applications. The restart 
mechanism I devised is designed to fill the gap, but I would acknowledge 
that it's not ideal.

I would have to revisit it to be able to say exactly how to reconfigure 
it for our new structure, but I think it should be possible.

It all depends what functionality users actually need. As I said, it's 
my impression that the capability which the existing code provides is at 
least vaguely useful in a coupled context, but perhaps it needs refinement.

All the best,

Ian
