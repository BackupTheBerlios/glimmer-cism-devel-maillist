Hi All,

&gt;<i> i also like this if form but i do not think that we should be that prescriptive about 
</I>&gt;<i> coding styles.
</I>
I think some coding guidelines are essential:

1) We have to know what Fortran standard we're aiming for, and whether 
any particular language features are to be avoided.

2) Consistently-written code (e.g. in terms of a naming convention, 
etc), is much easier to read, much easier to debug, etc.

To be honest, I can't think of a good reason not to do this.

&gt;<i> i have to say that i think it would be easier to create a set of flexible dynamical core 
</I>&gt;<i> routines if we avoided the use of derived types at this level.  can't they be use above 
</I>&gt;<i> and then their components passed as arguments?
</I>
I think this is going to far. Derived types are very useful to package 
up data, and they make it easier to avoid many classes of bugs. Any new 
component we might want to plug into Glimmer is going to need its 
interface tailoring to whatever standard API we have: including a few 
derived types in that standard makes no difference to how easy that is 
to do.

I suspect your specific concerns are to do with automatic 
differentiation and C/C++ interoperability. For the former, derived 
types are not a problem for OpenAD to handle - this was confirmed in 
Chicago the other week. For the latter, simple derived types should work 
fine with C/C++, especially if all you need to do is pass them through. 
Alternatively, just write a wrapper to pack/unpack the relevant derived 
types. I don't think it would be a good idea to allow this consideration 
to affect the fundamental engineering approach of the code, given that 
it is fairly simple to get round.

Cheers,

Ian
