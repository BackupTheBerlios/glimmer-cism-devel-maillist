Hi all,
ok, I understand. So checkpointing is not what you are after, although
that might be a useful thing. The hotstart and restart is very similar
in what they try to achieve. So I think we should try to merge both
functionalities. It seems to me that the hotstart code is good in that
it is just normal I/O. Once we move the I/O out of the ice sheet model
we should be able to generalise it a bit more to support what the
restart is doing. My impression of the restart code is that the entire
state is saved, so it is a bit like checkpointing. Presumably once the
restart files are loaded individual parameters can be overwritten. This
is very much like how the hotstart works. Only the computed fields are
stored in files, all other fields are either derived from the stored
fields or re-initialised from the parameter file (which might have
changed). So (apart from bugs) the hotstart code should do for the ice
sheet model. Maybe some similar functionality could be implemented for
glint. I also wonder if we should use native unformatted I/O for the
hotstart files? 
Cheers
