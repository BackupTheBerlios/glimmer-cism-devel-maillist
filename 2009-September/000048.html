Hi All,

I agree, the two mechanisms are similar in terms of what they're  
trying to achieve. Each has advantages and disadvantages. I think the  
big advantage of the restart code is that it's robust against model  
changes and will write/read the state of the whole model at any stage  
- the hotstart mechanism depends on someone figuring out what fields  
need to be saved, and can only be used at particular moments in the  
run. For a coupled model, this is a problem, as Jonathan indicates.

As far as the format of these files go, again, I think NetCDF is  
useful because it can be easily examined.

The problem with the restart code is that it's fairly invasive, and  
quite closely tied to the code it shadows. No doubt it could be  
streamlined, especially when we have access to some of the new F2003  
features.

My instinct is that we should retain both for the moment, as they  
address the needs of two different user groups. However, some of the  
code refactoring which is envisaged in the long term might help us  
solve the problem more elegantly. I'll give it some thought.

Cheers,

Ian

</I>&gt;<i> that might be a useful thing. The hotstart and restart is very similar
</I>&gt;<i> in what they try to achieve. So I think we should try to merge both
</I>&gt;<i> functionalities. It seems to me that the hotstart code is good in that
</I>&gt;<i> it is just normal I/O. Once we move the I/O out of the ice sheet model
</I>&gt;<i> we should be able to generalise it a bit more to support what the
</I>&gt;<i> restart is doing. My impression of the restart code is that the entire
</I>&gt;<i> state is saved, so it is a bit like checkpointing. Presumably once the
</I>&gt;<i> restart files are loaded individual parameters can be overwritten.  
</I>&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;<i> is very much like how the hotstart works. Only the computed fields are
</I>&gt;<i> stored in files, all other fields are either derived from the stored
</I>&gt;<i> fields or re-initialised from the parameter file (which might have
</I>&gt;<i> changed). So (apart from bugs) the hotstart code should do for the ice
</I>&gt;<i> sheet model. Maybe some similar functionality could be implemented for
</I>&gt;<i> glint. I also wonder if we should use native unformatted I/O for the
</I>&gt;<i> hotstart files?
