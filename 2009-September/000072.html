Forgive my naivety, but do you currently have planned (i.e. known when
the model is started instead of changing your mind after it's running)
restart capability, or are the current NetCDF output files only usable
for diagnostics?

In the parallel context, you have to make a choice of IO library.
NetCDF-4 has a parallel interface, but you have to commit to it, the
format is not backward compatible with 3 (since it uses the HDF5
backend).  There is also pnetcdf

  <A HREF="http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/parallel-netcdf">http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/parallel-netcdf</A>

But these solutions are based on MPI-IO which requires a good parallel
filesystem.  If you are running on a cheap cluster, you might just have
NFS and perhaps a faster local disk.  Simultaneously hitting NFS from a
bunch of nodes can be much slower than doing contiguous reads from a
single node.  PISM does all IO from node 0, in chunks (since the model
state can be much bigger than single-node memory) which are sent to/from
each process.  On machines with good filesystems, it just takes a few
seconds to read and distribute tens of GB of model state so this isn't a
terrible limitation for the sort of work we do (the day when we need
more than 10GB/s disk bandwidth is still a ways off).

&gt;<i> On that point, I had a play with the run-time plugin possibilities in
</I>&gt;<i> F2003, and got dynamic loading to work without intermediate C code (but
</I>&gt;<i> using libdl). Not suitable for us at the moment, as we're using F95
</I>&gt;<i> standards, but perhaps something for the future. In the meantime, clear,
</I>&gt;<i> consistent interfaces will help a lot.
</I>
Object creation is the interesting thing here.  The most common scheme
is to have a factory object which can be manipulated and perhaps fed
runtime options.  In the classical pattern, the factory's create method
has a switch over the implementations it knows about.  This isn't so
terrible, but it means that whoever provides a new implementation has to
be able to modify this switch statement.  A solution that is trivial in
C, and should also work with F2003's function pointers although I have
no experience with that, is to keep a map (usually global) from name
(string) to creation function.  Then the factory's create method just
looks up the name in the list.  When a library with a new implementation
is loaded, it registers itself in this map and all future creations will
be able to use it (with appropriate runtime options).

The classical factory pattern has some limitations.  I prefer a variant
of delegator/pimpl for this sort of thing, but the map of name to
creation function is the same.
