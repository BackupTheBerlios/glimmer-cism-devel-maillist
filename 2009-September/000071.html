Hi All,

Many thanks, Jed, for your comments.

&gt;<i> * restarts
</I>&gt;<i> BLCR will store much more data than is actually required to
</I>&gt;<i> restart your program.  This situation is much worse when you have an
</I>&gt;<i> assembled matrix hanging around.  While it will work in parallel, and
</I>&gt;<i> can be used to migrate a running job to different nodes, it can't do
</I>&gt;<i> things like change the number of nodes.  A possible option is to do what
</I>&gt;<i> PISM does which is to have a signal handler.  Thus &quot;pkill -USR1 pismr&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> would instruct PISM to write a checkpoint (the usual NetCDF file from
</I>&gt;<i> which we can restart) at the end of the current time step.  Is this the
</I>&gt;<i> sort of functionality that you were after, or am I missing the point?
</I>
I think this is the kind of thing. The model essentially needs to be 
restartable from an arbitrary point, in order to play well with a 
climate model (the Hadley Centre models in particular, but probably true 
of other cases). The thing is that these restart dumps might be due to 
routine checkpointing or other mid-run event, but they might also be the 
end-point of a spin-up run, and then be used as the starting point of 
multiple other runs of the coupled model. So, the ability to write an 
unambiguous state-dump of the model on demand is what is required. The 
appropriate technology, especially in a parallel context, is less clear.

&gt;<i> * DVCS:
</I>&gt;<i> Git can handle branches in-tree, and you do operations like reordering
</I>&gt;<i> recent history and editing patches before pushing using a small set of
</I>&gt;<i> commands.  
</I>
That's a good point. OK, I'm leaning back towards git... ;)

&gt;<i> I'll start the discussion of interoperability/plugins soon if nobody
</I>&gt;<i> else does.  (We should wait a day or two so that people have a chance to
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe.)
</I>
On that point, I had a play with the run-time plugin possibilities in 
F2003, and got dynamic loading to work without intermediate C code (but 
using libdl). Not suitable for us at the moment, as we're using F95 
standards, but perhaps something for the future. In the meantime, clear, 
consistent interfaces will help a lot.

Cheers,

Ian
