Ian,

Josh and I have been working on it but there is still plenty to do. I 
was hoping to have it done before Bill and I left for the modeling 
school in China, but I don't think we are probably going to make that 
deadline now. Close though ...

The majority of the work left is in cleaning up the higher-order test 
cases (which I'm working on now), getting them working w/ the automated 
test suite that Magi and Sarah set up, and adding all the Trilinos hooks 
to the build system. Josh was working on the latter but has been out 
sick for part of this week.

If anyone w/ netCDF and python expertise wants to help, I've got some 
issues w/ a few of the test cases that I could use help with.

cheers -

Steve

Hi Steve,

Ok - thanks. I didn't mean to imply that we should make the release with 
all bells and whistles asap - I know you're working hard on this and it 
takes time. It's more that I'm aware that our current release has at 
least one important bug, and it would be good to release a version where 
the bug is fixed as soon as possible.

The standard way of addressing this is to tag the release, and then make 
a bug-fix branch, allowing you to fix those bugs (as 1.7.2, 1.7.4, etc) 
without having to pull down unfinished developments from the trunk. This 
is what we did with the 1.0.x series. My original question was directed 
at seeing whether we could do this with the 1.7.0 release at this stage, 
because I didn't know where we might start from.

So I guess the question I have is this: is the tagged up 1.6.0 version 
on the glimmer-cism2 trunk better than the currently released 1.7.0 
version? By which I mean, does it have broadly the same functionality 
but fewer bugs? If so, then I think we should release it now, and start 
a bug-fix branch.

Hope that makes sense,

Ian

I think bug on 1.7 is ok since it was a preview release.

I believe the 1.6 series shouldn't have the bug. I have just merged the 
test suite stuff in 1.6 and am compiling it. So I think we should make a 
1.6.2 release and upload the tar balls. This won't include the HO stuff, 
however, it allows us to point those who are not interested in the HO 
physics to a reasonably well working model.

I think Magi just answered this. 1.6 does not have the higher order 
physics, but since the bug was in the SIA cases only (correct?), perhaps 
it makes sense to fix it there and leave the current 1.7 (beta) release 
as is?

We should also confirm that the SIA bug is fixed in the new 
merge/release we are working on.

Hi all,

Thanks to Magnus for working on the version 1.6 testing.  If it  
passes, we can make the tarball.  If it fails, I'll want to know about  
it and fix it, because this would likely mean there's a bug in the  
version of Glimmer-CISM in CESM.

Cheers,
Bill

Ok - thanks both for the explanation. It makes more sense now, and I'm 
sorry for forgetting that 1.7 is a beta release. Two things in response:

1) Yes, I agree we should release 1.6.0, as soon as the tests are 
implemented and OK.

2) I think that, even for beta releases, it's good to have a mechanism 
for fixing bugs in a released version, especially those which affect 
functionality also present in earlier versions. I know of a few users 
who have downloaded 1.7.0 without realising quite how 'beta' it is.

I'm happy to sort this out myself - probably at some point in the next 
week or two - what do you think?

Cheers,

Ian

Message-ID: <4D74CC38.3070805@bristol.ac.uk>

Hi, 

We should also confirm that the SIA bug is fixed in the new merge/release we are working on.

There is still a bug in the merge branch when running with SIA, even after re-setting the higher order velocities to the SIA velocity's (i.e velocity%hom%uvel = velocity%uvel and velocity%hom%vvel = velocity%vvel) 

For the e1-fm.1 eismint-1 test, the thickness at the ice divide is different to the benchmark values. 

Here are the thicknesses at the ice divide 

merge branch : 3334 m     (from glimmer-cism/glimmer-cism2/branches/glimmer-cism-lanl/ checked out this morning)
version 1.7.1: 3425 m 
version 1.0.4: 3425 m
Benchmark    : 3419.9 ? 1.7

This suggests there is still a bug or some other changes are needed to run the model under SIA. Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions? 

Cheers, 

Sarah

Hi all,
I have just merged the test suite stuff into STABLE_1_6. I get exactly 
the same results with STABLE_1_6 and gc2/trunk. Sarah, did you spend 
some time checking that the EISMINT runs from gc2/trunk are ok? If so, 
STABLE_1_6 should be ok as well.

Do we want to add EISMINT-3 as well to our automatic test suite?

The other thing we haven't resolved is what to do about the glint test. 
Currently we don't have the data in subversion because it is relatively 
chunky. However, we could stick the data on our berlios ftp site and 
instruct the user to download it.

Cheers

I think that the best thing to do is run the tests showing the bug using 
a fresh checkout/build of the beta release to see if it is also in 
there. If so, and once it is fixed, we'd have to make/post a new tarball 
and send a message to Cryolist (and whatever other lists we are using to 
get this information out there).

Hi Magnus, 

Sarah, did you spend some time checking that the EISMINT runs from gc2/trunk are ok?

The EISMINT-1 tests compare reasonably well to the benchmark on the gc2/trunk, however I haven't checked the EISMINT-2 tests.  

I uploaded a table to the wiki, showing the thickness and basal temperature at the ice divide for the gc2/trunk, the merge branch, version 1.0.4 and the benchmark values.

ok, the EISMINT-2 tests need to be compared as well. I'll look into that 
for gc2/trunk.

Hi all,
I have run the EISMINT 2 tests for both v 1.0.18 and current gc2-trunk. 
I have compared the results against the values quoted in the EISMINT-2 
paper. You can see the comparisons here:
http://xweb.geos.ed.ac.uk/~mhagdorn/compare/
run 1 is v 1.0.18
run 2 is current gc2 trunk
they mostly look the same and indeed looking at the vertical temperature 
profile for divide and off divide locations, they are the same with the 
exception of experiment H. Experiment H switches sliding on. I seem to 
remember that there was a bug in the dim and distant past which Ian fixed.

Apart from experiment H, we don't seem to have changed anything and the 
results fall within the results reported in the paper.

Does anyone have an idea of what might be going on with exp H?

I think once we have resolved the issue with exp H, we should be able to 
say that gc2-trunk has passed the EISMINT 1 and 2 tests and we should be 
able to make an official 1.6.2 release.

Hi,
I was wondering if anyone knows whether trilinos now works on the 
parallel/soon to be released branch?

When running a simulation for Antarctica, I get a bunch of errors saying 
the model doesn't converge (see below)


Belos::StatusTestOutput: Passed
    (Num calls,Mod test,State test): (101, 1, Passed Failed Undefined)
     Passed.......OR Combination ->
       Failed.......Number of Iterations = 100 == 100
       Unconverged..(2-Norm Res Vec) / (2-Norm Prec Res0)
                    residual [ 0 ] = 0.99553 > 0.001
 
The Belos solver of type "Belos::BlockGmresSolMgr<...,double>{Ortho 
Type='DGKS', Block Size=1, Num Blocks=100, Max Restarts=20}" returned a 
solve status of "SOLVE_STATUS_UNCONVERGED with total CPU time of 42.5647 sec

Perhaps someone has seen these types of errors before.
Cheers,
Sarah

Sarah,

I'm guessing from the attached output that the
Trilinos code is hooked up fine, but that the
linear solver is just not converging for this
problem with these settings. 

As the problems move to more processors, and get
more ill-conditioned from the model description, the
linear systems get more difficult to solve. There
are parameters in the input file strat1.xml that
can increase the robustness (and expense) of the
preconditioner. Unfortunately, it is hard to have
one setting that works across the board, and that
is not too slow for smaller-serial runs. 

So, as an attempt to fix the problem, edit the
strat1.xml file and increase the Overlap and 
level-of-fill flags incrementally, separately 
and/or together (from 0 to 1 to 2). (These
are standard options with ILU preconditioners
-- I can give explanations if you like.) For
a Greenland model that we were running a year 
ago, we had to switch overlap from 0 to 1 as
the processor count went up and that solve the
problem.

I can try and give more specific guidance, but
I'd need to know more about the problem size,
number of processors, and would turn on more
verbose output from the Belos solver.

Trilinos works in the "parallel" branch but not the "merged" branch
(glimmer-cism2/branches/glimmer-cism-lanl) which will become the released
branch yet.

Hi all,
I have added some more detailed comparison plots for the EISMINT-2 Exp H 
runs which you can see here:
http://xweb.geos.ed.ac.uk/~mhagdorn/compare/e2.h/
It looks like something changed with the basal sliding treatment.
